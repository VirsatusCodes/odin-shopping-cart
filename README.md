current known bugs

-when selecting amount of product to purchase initial value is
0, could alter to be '' and check value in the incrementer to avoid
converting to a string.

-when switching pages between items the current set quantity remains
(though it is reset to 0 when placing an order)

-if screen gets too small website styling breaks in catalogue (probably all)

-not sure if i want the nav icon cart to grow with quantity purchased
or number of unique items purchased
